# Evidence Collector and Validator

## How It Works

- 📸 You provide screenshots (most image format e.g. PNG, JPG) of system configurations.
- 🧠 The script uses **Tesseract OCR** to extract visible text.
- 🛡️ It checks for misconfiguration indicators using keyword rules for each strategy.
- 📄 Outputs findings into a CSV report: `scan_report.csv`.

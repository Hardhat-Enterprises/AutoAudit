# AutoAudit Monitoring and Alerting Guide

## Overview

This document details the monitoring and alerting strategy for the AutoAudit system to ensure high availability, performance, and security.

## Monitoring Components

- **Kubernetes Cluster Monitoring**: Use Prometheus and Grafana for cluster metrics, pod health, and resource utilisation.
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**: Integrate with Azure Application Insights for tracing and performance metrics.
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralise logs using Azure Log Analytics or ELK stack with structured logging.

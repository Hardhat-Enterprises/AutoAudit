# AutoAudit Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Resolutions

### CI/CD Pipeline Failures

- **Symptom:** Pipeline fails during dependency installation.  
  **Resolution:** Verify `pipenv` and `npm` lock files are up to date. Check network connectivity and package repository availability.

- **Symptom:** Linting or static analysis errors.  
  **Resolution:** Review linting output, fix code style violations, and re-run pipeline.

- **Symptom:** Docker build fails.  
  **Resolution:** Check Dockerfile syntax, base image availability, and build context. Use local Docker build for debugging.

### Deployment Issues

- **Symptom:** Kubernetes pods crash or restart frequently.  
  **Resolution:** Inspect pod logs with `kubectl logs`. Check resource limits and environment variables.

- **Symptom:** Health checks fail post-deployment.  
  **Resolution:** Verify service endpoints, network policies, and ingress configurations.

### Secrets and Authentication

- **Symptom:** Authentication failures with Azure or Docker registry.  
  **Resolution:** Confirm validity and permissions of service principal and registry credentials. Rotate secrets if necessary.

### Debugging Tools

- Use `docker logs <container>` to inspect container output.
- Use `docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash` for interactive debugging.
- Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` for detailed pod status.
- Use `kubectl get events` to view cluster events.

## Escalation Procedures

- Document all troubleshooting steps and findings.
- Escalate unresolved issues to any Senior Lead or the DevSecOps Team Lead.
- Open incident tickets with detailed logs and reproduction steps.

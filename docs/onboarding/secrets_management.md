# Secrets Management in AutoAudit

## Overview

Secure handling of secrets is critical to maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the AutoAudit system. This document outlines best practices and technical implementations for managing secrets across development, CI/CD, and production environments.

## Local Development

- Use `.env` files to store environment-specific secrets such as API keys, database credentials, and tokens.
- `.env` files **must** be excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
- Use `pipenv` or `dotenv` libraries to load environment variables securely during local development.

## CI/CD Pipeline

- Secrets are stored securely in GitHub repository secrets.
- During pipeline execution, secrets are injected as environment variables.
- Use GitHub Actions `secrets` context to access secrets without exposing them in logs.
- Rotate secrets regularly and update pipeline secrets accordingly.

## Production Environment

- Use Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault for centralised secrets management.
- Integrate secrets retrieval into deployment scripts and runtime configuration.
- Implement automatic secret rotation policies with zero downtime.
- Encrypt secrets at rest using AES-256 encryption.
- Limit access to secrets using role-based access control (RBAC) and least privilege principles.

## Avoid

- Hardcoding secrets in source code or Dockerfiles.
- Committing secrets to any version control system.
- Logging secrets or sensitive information in CI/CD logs.

## Incident Response

- Immediately revoke and rotate any secrets suspected to be compromised.
- Conduct a security audit to identify the scope of exposure.
- Update all dependent systems and notify stakeholders.

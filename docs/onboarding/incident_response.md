# AutoAudit Incident Response Plan

## Purpose

To provide a structured, repeatable, and auditable process for responding to security incidents affecting the AutoAudit platform, minimising impact and ensuring compliance.

## Incident Classification

# Incident Severity Levels and Response Workflow

## Severity Levels

| Severity Level | Description                                   | Response Time Objective | Escalation Path                      |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Critical       | Active breach, data exfiltration, or service outage | < 15 minutes           | Immediate escalation to CISO and SOC |
| High           | Exploitable vulnerability or suspicious activity | < 1 hour               | Notify Security Lead and DevOps Manager |
| Medium         | Policy violation or non-critical anomaly       | < 4 hours              | Document and monitor               |
| Low            | Informational or false positive                  | N/A                    | Log and review periodically       |

## Incident Response Workflow

### Detection and Identification

- Automated alerts from monitoring systems (e.g., Azure Sentinel, Prometheus).
- Manual reports from users or developers.

### Containment

- Isolate the affected systems or pods using Kubernetes Network Policies.
- Revoke the compromised credentials immediately.

### Eradication

- Remove malicious code or artifacts.
- Patch vulnerabilities and update dependencies.

### Recovery

- Restore services from clean backups or snapshots.
- Validate system integrity and functionality.

### Post-Incident Analysis

- Conduct root cause analysis.
- Update documentation, playbooks, and training.

## Communication Protocols

- Incident Commander coordinates communication.
- Use encrypted channels (e.g., Microsoft Teams with E2E encryption).
- Maintain detailed incident logs with timestamps and actions.

## Documentation and Record Keeping

- All incident details recorded with linked evidence.
- Audit logs from Kubernetes, Azure, and CI/CD pipelines are archived securely.
- Compliance reports generated for regulatory audits.

## Training and Drills

- Quarterly incident response drills with cross-functional teams.
- Continuous improvement based on lessons learned.

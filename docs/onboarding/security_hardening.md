# AutoAudit Security Hardening Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the security hardening measures implemented and recommended for the AutoAudit project to ensure compliance with enterprise security standards and protect against common attack vectors.

## Container Security

- Use minimal base images (e.g., `python:3.11-slim`) to reduce the attack surface.
- Run containers as non-root users with explicit UID/GID.
- Use read-only root filesystem where possible.
- Drop all unnecessary Linux capabilities using Docker `--cap-drop=ALL` and selectively add required ones.
- Enable seccomp and AppArmor profiles for container confinement.
- Regularly scan container images with Trivy and remediate vulnerabilities promptly.

## Network Security

- Use Kubernetes Network Policies to restrict pod-to-pod communication.
- Enforce TLS encryption for all internal and external service communication.
- Use Azure Private Link or VNet integration for secure cloud resource access.

## Secrets Management

- Store secrets in Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault.
- Use Kubernetes Secrets with encryption at rest enabled.
- Avoid environment variable injection of secrets where possible; prefer volume mounts with restricted permissions.

## CI/CD Pipeline Security

- Enforce branch protection rules and mandatory code reviews.
- Use signed commits and tags.
- Limit GitHub Actions runner permissions to least privilege.
- Audit pipeline logs regularly for suspicious activity.

## Logging and Auditing

- Centralise logs using Azure Monitor or ELK stack.
- Enable audit logging on Kubernetes clusters.
- Retain logs for a minimum of 90 days for compliance.

## Incident Response

- Define clear escalation paths and incident response playbooks.
- Automate alerting for anomalous activities.
- Conduct regular security drills and penetration testing.

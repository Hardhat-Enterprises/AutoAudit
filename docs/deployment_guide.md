# AutoAudit Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide provides detailed instructions for deploying the AutoAudit application to staging and production environments using the CI/CD pipeline and Kubernetes orchestration.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters for staging and production.
- Valid Azure service principal credentials with appropriate permissions.
- Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry credentials.
- Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) configured with cluster access.
- Terraform CLI installed and configured.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare The Environment

- Ensure all environment variables and secrets are configured in GitHub repository settings.
- Validate Kubernetes context is set to the target cluster.

```bash
kubectl config current-context
```bash

# AutoAudit Deployment Steps

## 2. Trigger The CI/CD Pipeline

- Push code changes to the `develop` branch for staging deployment.
- Merge pull requests into the `main` branch for production deployment.

## 3. Monitor The Pipeline's Execution

- Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow for build, test, and deployment stages.
- Review logs carefully for any errors or warnings.

## 4. Verify The Deployment

### Check Kubernetes Pods Status

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
```bash

# Deployment Verification and Rollback Procedures

## Confirm Pod Status

Ensure all Kubernetes pods are in the `Running` state with no restarts.

## Access Application Endpoints and Verify Health Checks

```bash
kubectl get svc -n <namespace>
curl -f http://<service-ip>/health || echo "Health check failed"
```bash

# Rollback Procedure

If deployment fails or issues arise, rollback to the previous stable deployment:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name> -n <namespace>
```bash

# Rollback Monitoring and Post-Deployment Actions

## Monitor Rollback Status

- Continuously monitor the rollback process to ensure it completes successfully.
- Verify application stability after rollback by checking system health and logs.

## Post-Deployment Actions

- Run smoke tests to validate critical functionality.
- Notify stakeholders of deployment status.
- Document any deviations or incidents in project logs.

# AutoAudit: Comprehensive Technical Overview and Developer Guide

## 1. Executive Summary

AutoAudit is a mission-critical, enterprise-grade Microsoft 365 (M365) compliance automation platform architected and developed by multiple specialised teams. This monorepo consolidates all discrete codebases—including backend APIs, compliance scanning engines, security modules, frontend user experience components, and DevSecOps workflows—into a unified repository. This consolidation enables rigorous code ownership, traceability, and auditability, while facilitating a robust, scalable, and secure CI/CD pipeline that supports rapid, automated cloud deployments.

This document serves as the definitive technical reference for all stakeholders—developers, security engineers, DevSecOps professionals, and leadership—detailing repository structure, branching and release strategies, contribution protocols, CI/CD pipeline architecture, and operational governance. It is crafted with exhaustive technical precision to anticipate and address all foreseeable logistical, administrative, and technical queries, ensuring seamless onboarding, development, deployment, and maintenance aligned with enterprise security and compliance mandates.

## 2. Repository Structure and Code Ownership

The repository is meticulously organised into top-level directories, each representing a distinct team or service domain. This modularisation enforces strict code ownership boundaries, minimises merge conflicts, and supports granular audit trails.

| Directory           | Description                                                                                      | Ownership Team          | Key Responsibilities                                  |

## 3. Branching and Release Strategy

The branching model is designed to enforce stability, quality, and controlled feature integration, aligned with enterprise release management best practices.

| Branch Name               | Purpose                                               | Protection Policies                                  | Deployment Target          |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `main`                    | Production-ready stable releases only                  | Mandatory PR reviews (2+ approvers), signed commits, CI pass required | Production environment     |
| `staging`                 | Pre-release integration and final QA                   | PR reviews, CI pass required                         | Staging environment        |
| `dev`                     | Active integration branch for all teams                | CI pass required                                     | Development environment    |
| `feature/<team>-<desc>`   | Team-specific feature or bugfix branches                | PR to `dev` branch only                              | N/A                       |
| `hotfix/<desc>`           | Emergency fixes branched from `main`                    | PR to `main` branch only                             | Production environment     |

### Pull Request Workflow

- All changes must be submitted via Pull Requests targeting the appropriate integration branch.
- PRs require descriptive titles, detailed change summaries, and linkage to relevant issue tracking tickets.
- Automated CI checks (linting, testing, security scans) must pass before approval.
- Reviewers must include at least one senior developer and one security engineer for security-sensitive changes.
- Merge commits are signed and tagged with semantic versioning where applicable.

---

## 4. Contribution Guidelines and Code Quality Standards

### Code Ownership and Modularity

- Developers must work exclusively within their designated team directories to maintain modularity and ownership clarity.
- Cross-team dependencies require documented interfaces and joint code reviews.

### Coding Standards

- **Python**: Adhere strictly to PEP8 with enforced type hinting and comprehensive docstrings. Use `black` for formatting and `mypy` for static type checking.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Follow Airbnb style guide with ESLint and Prettier enforcement.
- **Security**: All code must implement input validation, output encoding, and adhere to the principle of least privilege.
- **Testing**: Unit tests with minimum 90% coverage are mandatory for all new code and bug fixes. Integration and end-to-end tests are required for cross-module changes.

### Documentation

- All new features and modules must include detailed technical documentation within `/docs/onboarding/`.
- Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) must be created for all significant design or security decisions.
- Inline comments must explain complex logic and security considerations explicitly.

## 5. CI/CD Pipeline Architecture and Operational Details

### Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using **GitHub Actions** integrated with **Google Cloud Build** for container image builds and deployments to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The pipeline is optimised for efficiency, security, and compliance, with path-based triggers to selectively build and test only affected services.

### Pipeline Stages

| Stage                      | Description                                                                                      | Tools/Technologies                      | Security & Compliance Controls                          |

| Dependency Installation    | Installs Python and Node.js dependencies deterministically using lockfiles.                     | `pipenv`, `npm ci`                     | Dependency vulnerability scanning integrated            |
| Static Code Analysis       | Runs linters and security scanners (`flake8`, `bandit`, `eslint`).                             | SonarQube, Bandit, ESLint              | Fails pipeline on critical security issues              |
| Unit & Integration Testing | Executes comprehensive test suites with coverage reporting.                                   | `pytest`, `Jest`                       | Minimum 90% coverage enforced                            |
| Docker Image Build         | Builds multi-stage Docker images with build secrets and caching.                              | Docker Buildx, BuildKit                | Secrets injected securely; no secrets in image layers   |
| Container Security Scanning| Scans images for vulnerabilities using Trivy and Aqua Security.                               | Trivy, Aqua Security                   | Zero tolerance for critical/high vulnerabilities        |
| Image Signing & Notarisation| Signs images with Cosign and uploads signatures to registry.                                  | Cosign, Notary                        | Ensures image provenance and integrity                   |
| Image Push                 | Pushes images to Google Artifact Registry with immutable tags.                               | Google Artifact Registry               | Enforces retention and immutability policies            |
| Infrastructure Provisioning| Applies Terraform templates for GCP resource provisioning and drift detection.                | Terraform, gcloud CLI                  | State stored securely with encryption and access control|
| Kubernetes Deployment      | Deploys Helm charts with blue-green and canary strategies.                                   | Helm, Kubernetes                      | Automated rollback on failure; health checks enforced   |
| Post-Deployment Validation | Runs smoke tests and synthetic transactions to verify deployment success.                     | Custom scripts, Kubernetes probes      | Failure triggers rollback and incident creation          |
| Notifications             | Sends detailed deployment reports to Slack, email, and Jira.                                | Slack API, SMTP, Jira API              | Includes audit trail and metadata                        |

### Environment Variables and Secrets

- All secrets are stored encrypted in GitHub Secrets and Google Secret Manager.
- Secrets are injected only at runtime and never logged or stored in artifacts.
- Ephemeral credentials with automatic rotation are used for all service principals and tokens.
- Strict RBAC policies govern access to secrets and deployment environments.

### Deployment Triggers

- `dev` branch triggers development environment deployments.
- `staging` branch triggers pre-production deployments with manual approval gates.
- `main` branch triggers production deployments with mandatory peer review and signed commits.
- Feature branches run complete CI checks, excluding deployment.

### Rollback and Disaster Recovery

- Automated rollback triggered by failed health checks or canary analysis.
- Manual rollback via Kubernetes `rollout undo` commands with audit logging.
- Disaster recovery includes cluster snapshots and backup restoration procedures.

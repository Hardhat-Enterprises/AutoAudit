Application control policy – Windows workstations

We enforce rules to block executable files (.exe and .com) from running in
standard user and temp folders. These executable files are explicitly blocked
using AppLocker / Windows Defender Application Control, and the rules are
currently enforced on all endpoints.

Examples:
 - blocked file: winword.exe in %USERPROFILE%\Downloads
 - blocked file: setup.com in C:\Users\Public\Temp

The application control rules are enforced and reviewed quarterly by the
security team.
